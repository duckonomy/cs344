    "**Q.** *The earliest psychologists studied the human mind using introspection. Would this be a good way for researchers to gain insight into human cognitive processes for the purpose of modelling those processes? (Please give a one-to-two-paragraph answer.)*\n",
    "\n",
    "**A.** Introspection at best is limited by the biological capabilities of humans at a given moment. Even with a huge prefrontal cortex, it is hard for most people to even grasp large problems for a prolonged time. To make it worse, evolutionary human instincts can differ in each individual. Thus, if one were to model the human cognitive processes based soley on introspection, there will be many misleading results. Rather, it would be more reasonable to take an external look at the biological processes of human thinking. If there was enough data, however, introspection could give us some insight."

However, hill-climbing was faster, which makes sense because it just lands on the closest local maximum and simulated-annealing needs time to cool down. I would say that if the problem was larger with more local maximums, simulated-annealing would be better because it could search for more possibilities."
