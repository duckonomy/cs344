* Exercise 1
 a. Which algorithms work (in a timely manner) and which donâ€™t? Explain your results in terms of the capabilities (and implementations) of the algorithms and nature of the problems.

 b. What effect does configuring the settings for backtracking have on the results? Try the following:
    1. Set the variable/value ordering (i.e., the ~select_unassigned_variable~ parameter) to first-unassigned-variable (the default) or minimum-remaining-values (i.e., ~mrv~). 
    2. Set the inference (i.e., the inference parameter) to forward-checking (i.e., ~forward_checking~). 
 Which, if any, of these settings should work best for sudoku? What combination of settings actually works the best?
