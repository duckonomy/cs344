Exercise 8.3
  a. They recommend FTRL for L1 optimization, but the code specifies the same rate (learning_rate) for all runs. How is FTRL managing the learning rate?
    - It controls how the learning rate decreases through the training through the learning_rate_power (found in the link to the documentation).
	
  b. What good does the bucketing/binning do?
    - It can simplify the data by making it discrete (Rather than continuous). Thus, we are able to explore the data with discrete methods without turning to complex methods.
	
  c. Submit your solutions to tasks 1â€“2. Did you find their task 1 bucketing to make sense? Identify one unique feature cross for task 2 and explain how it could be useful.
    Task 1.
       bucketized_latitude = tf.feature_column.bucketized_column(
      latitude, boundaries=get_quantile_based_boundaries(
        training_examples["latitude"], 10))
  	  
      bucketized_housing_median_age = tf.feature_column.bucketized_column(
        housing_median_age, boundaries=get_quantile_based_boundaries(
          training_examples["housing_median_age"], 10))
  		
      bucketized_median_income = tf.feature_column.bucketized_column(
        median_income, boundaries=get_quantile_based_boundaries(
          training_examples["median_income"], 10))
  		
      bucketized_rooms_per_person = tf.feature_column.bucketized_column(
        rooms_per_person, boundaries=get_quantile_based_boundaries(
          training_examples["rooms_per_person"], 10))

      Final RMSE = 89.21

      I'm not sure if bucketing these features makes sense. Because bucketing is used to convert continuous data to discrete data.
		
	Task 2.
      long_x_lat = tf.feature_column.crossed_column([
	  bucketized_longitude, bucketized_latitude], 1000)
    
      Final RMSE = 80.36

      The exercise indicates that a feature cross between bucketized longitude and latitude could be useful because it can give us information about which city block at a particular lat/lon can be more expensive than others.
