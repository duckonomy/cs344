	  This is an application made for my CS344(Artificial Intelligence) project at Calvin University for the Spring semester. It is a Korean Community site post generator trained and fine-tuned with scraped data from two infamous and popular Korean community sites. My primary influence was Microsoft's Twitter bot Tay. It utilizes two models: a LSTM model that I trained and a GPT-2 model that I fine-tuned.
