    "My initial goal for this project is to create a forum bot that posts belivable posts. Every internet community has a unique culture and a unique way to speech. I want to be able to imitate these communities through machine learning. The broad field would be natural language processing. However, to obtain the information, I will also be doing some web-scraping on my target sites. For the machine learning, as many chat bots and twitter bots do, I will have to implement a Recurrant Neural Network (RNN) to learn on a given corpus of text.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since there are many bots and methods to do feature engineering for English, I want to focus on working with the Korean language. This is also a challenge in data collection because many Korean community sites do not have readily available APIs (like twitter) that I can interact with."
