Exercise 10.3

  a. Task 1: What does the confusion matrix show for this example?
   - It shows which classes were misclassified as other classes.

  b. Task 2: How does the TensorFlow network architecture differ from the Keras example given in class? Report any improvements you can make over the baseline testset accuracy for this task.
   - Tensorflow architecture has 2 hidden layers with 100 nodes with relu. The one in class had different amount of nodes for each layer and a different activation function. I wasn't sure how to create improvements over the baseline testset accuracy.

  c. Task 3: What differences can you see between the visualizations for 10 steps and 1000 steps?
   - It was difficult to distinguish images at 10 steps because of their quality. At 1000 steps, you could definitely distinguish them from each other.
